# M344 Discrete Mathematics - Exam Preparation Slides

This directory contains Beamer slides for M344 Discrete Mathematics exam preparation, created in the Yolymatics Tutorials style.

## Content

The slides cover exam-style problems across three sections:

### Section A: Short Answer Problems (30 marks)
1. Ring Arithmetic (modulo 3)
2. Modular Equations (existence and uniqueness)
3. Euler's Theorem (assumptions and notation)
4. Chinese Remainder Theorem (application and uniqueness)
5. Linear Combinations and GCD (coprimality)
6. Euler's Totient Function (computation)
7. Distribution Problem (combinatorics)
8. Outcomes with Constraints (counting)
9. Complement Counting (inclusion-exclusion)
10. Graph Isomorphism (construction)

### Section B: Medium Problems (15 marks)
11. Combinatorial Word Problem (committee formation)
12. Constrained Sequences (Cartesian products with proof)
13. Number Theory Proof (divisibility with coprimality)

### Section C: Advanced Problems (15 marks)
14. Graph Theory Analysis (complete/bipartite/cycle/path, isomorphisms, connected subgraphs)
15. Combined Concepts (coprimality graph with connectivity proofs)

### Reference Material
- Number Theory (Euclidean Algorithm, Bézout's Identity, Euler's Theorem, CRT, Euler's Totient)
- Combinatorics (Permutations, Combinations, Multisets, Inclusion-Exclusion, Complement)
- Graph Theory (Definitions, Complete/Bipartite graphs, Cycles, Paths, Isomorphism, Connectivity)
- Problem-Solving Strategies (time allocation, common mistakes)

## Format

Each problem follows the Yolymatics teaching style:
- Problem statement on one slide
- Blank working space slide(s) for stylus annotation during teaching
- NO worked solutions (for live problem-solving with students)
